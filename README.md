# Automatically Predict Material Properties with Microscopic Image: Example Polymer Miscibility


We realized the polymer miscibility prediction with SEM images through tranfer learning method.

The alghorism is realized with python, and the details are presented in the Model_nopre.py and Model_pre.py.

The dataset used in the machine learning method is established by collecting the published researches, and all images are storaged in NIMS_image. 

Manual directory is the manual recognition results.
