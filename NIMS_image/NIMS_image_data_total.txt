All the samples clearly present a two-phase structure, i.e., a continuous SPMS phase and a dispersed SEBS phase. For SPMS/SEBS blends with the Sare composition, 90/ 10, the size of the SEBS dispersed particles becomes smaller upon raising blending time from 3 min (Fig. 4a) to 20 min (Fig. 4d). The sarple blended for 3 min presents a rougher surface with the SEBS particles having broad range of sizes. The sample blended for 20 min (Fig. 4d presents a smoother cross-section surface with smaller SEBS particles, probably due to the more SEBS material miscible with SPMS.This morphology observation reveals that the higher the SEBS content in the blends, the more difficult it is to obtain a fine disper-sion.

average particle diameter 0.03-0.22micron by SEM
As clearly shown in Figure 7(a), the size of the ungrafted POE particles Was rather large. Upon frac- ture, the POE particles were pulled off of the PTT matrix and left many round holes, which had a smooth surface. In addition, the particle size distribution of POE in the PTT matrix was rather broad (from 1.7 to 7.0 um). It indicated that the PTT /POE binary blends exhibited poor interfacial adhesion because of poor interaction. A similar result was reported in PET/POE blends.12 Compared with PTT /POE, PTT/mPOE displayed a significantly finer morphology.

unclear
At high sPS values (72/18/10) [Fig. 4(a)l, HDPE dispersion is very fine and the distinction between phases is scarcely detectable. Coalescence of HDPE particles into a continuous phase is found at 36/54/10 wt.% [Fig. 4 (b)] At 18/72/10 the size of the dispersed sPS particles is not different from that found in the corresponding 20/80 binary blend [Fig. 4 (o)]: however, an interfacial layer of SEBS between the domains is found. It is likely that during melt mixing the presence of SEBS lowers the interfacial tension between the components on one hand, and improves the adhesion at the interface on the other hand. However, the larger size of the sPS particles compared to those of the HDPE particles, when each are present as the minor phase, suggests that the compatibilizer is more effective in reducing the surface tension of HDPE than that of sPS. Such an effect is probably due to a major dissolution of aliphatic blocks of SEBS into the HDPE phase than of polystyrene blocks into the sPS phase.

On the other hand, LDPE-g-MAH surfaces are very rough and the shape of the MAH particles is irregular, which indicates that MAH monomers were grafted onto LDPE as shown in Figure 2(b). The blends without added LDPE-g-MAH display low interfacial adhesion and poor dispersion of the minor phase droplet size.

Coarse morphology, large dispersed spherical LCP phase separated in the PEI matrix and poor adhesion between LCP and PEI matrix observed (SEM)
In the binary blend Fig. 11(b) void formation resulting from phase separation, a dispersed spherical phase, and poor adhesion between the LCP and the matrix are observed. The LCP domains are relatively large because of immiscibility, thereby leading to poor dispersion. The micrographs also demonstrate poor adhesion between the two phases, which leads to an open ring hole around the LCP domain while LCP is pulled out during the fracture of the samples.

Fine LCP phase domain of compatibilized blend observed in the PEI matrix (SEM), interplanar distance (d)=5.35angstrom, cryst. size (p)=48.27angstrom (XRD)
The ternary blend surface Fig. 11(c) shows a different morphology. It is well known that the major functions of a compatibilizer are to reduce interfacial tension between two immiscible polymers, to permit a finer dispersion during mixing, to provide phase stability against gross segregation upon melt processing, and to broaden interface thickness [30]. A wider interfacial thickness normally reflects a stronger interfacial adhesion and allows for a more efficient stress transfer under stress conditions as well as improved mechanical properties. The formation of the desired PEI-co-silicone rubber-co-LCP copolymers during melt processing leads to lower interfacial tension and phase stabilization against drop coalescence.

Finer LCP phase domain of compatibilized blend observed in the PEI matrix (SEM)
Therefore, the dispersed LCP particle size shows a dramatic reduction and decreases with increasing the compatibilizers (Fig. 1ld). Those desired copolymers are also responsible for the improved interfacial adhesion in the solid state. The finer phase domain of the compatibilized blends with higher silicone rubber content (10%) is the evidence of better compatibilization as shown in Fig. 11(d).

Scanning electron micrographs of PTT/PC blends.
Partially miscible, considerable interaction between the blend components (PTT and PC) due to the transesterification reaction
We observed a similar result from the SEM micrographs of PTT/PC blends presented in Figure 1. The SEM pictures reveal that from 10 to 30 wt % of polycarbonate in the blend, the PTT phase is the matrix and PC is the dispersed phase. The variation in dispersed particle size (Dn and Dw) with PC content is presented in Figure 2. It is obvious from this that as the weight percent of PC in the PTT matrix increases particle size increases and beyond a certain limit of composition (30 wt %) both PTT and PC form a cocontinuous phase structure. The phase inversion occurs at PTT/PC. 40/60 composition where PC forms the matrix in which PTT is distributed as dispersed particles. This is a typical morphology of an Incompatible heterogeneous binary blend.

Scanning electron micrographs of PTT/PC blends.
Partially miscible, considerable interaction between the blend components (PTT and PC) due to the transesterification reaction
We observed a similar result from the SEM micrographs of PTT/PC blends presented in Figure 1. The SEM pictures reveal that from 10 to 30 wt % of polycarbonate in the blend, the PTT phase is the matrix and PC is the dispersed phase. The variation in dispersed particle size (Dn and Dw) with PC content is presented in Figure 2. It is obvious from this that as the weight percent of PC in the PTT matrix increases particle size increases and beyond a certain limit of composition (30 wt %) both PTT and PC form a cocontinuous phase structure. The phase inversion occurs at PTT/PC. 40/60 composition where PC forms the matrix in which PTT is distributed as dispersed particles. This is a typical morphology of an Incompatible heterogeneous binary blend.

SEM microphotographs of PS/SMA8 blends (a) 27/75, (b) 50/50, and (c) 75/25 w/w.
Immiscible blend;two Tg and dispersed sphere particle size;0.3-0.6micron by SEM
As can be seen from the microphotographs, in all blends the separate phases are very well distinguished. In the PS/SMA8 25/75 and 75/25 w/w blends, the dispersed phase is in the form of homogeneous spheres with a radius between 0.3 and 0.6 uum, which is a little higher than in PGI/SMA8 blends. In 50/50 w/w composition, there is a small enhancement in the continuities of the phases compared to the COrresponding of PGI/SMA8 blend. In the PS/SMA14 blends, the size of the phases is larger at all compositions compared to those of PS/SMA8 blends. Thus, in the 25/75 W/w blends, the dispersed phase is on the order of 0.3-1.1 wm, whereas in the 50/50 w/w blend, the dispersed phase cannot be distinguished. The above observations in PS/SMA blends are in line with the wel-detected glass transitions by DMTA and DSC techniques, probably due to the higher phase size compared to that of SMA8/PGI blends.

In our case, SEM pictures were collected from the extruded samples, and the Surfaces did not show traces of a dispersed phase in any composition [Fig. 4(a)] for the 60:40 mixture. Moreover, in a previous article, the biphasic morphology was better detected after a solvent etching treatment.6 Thus, we decided to follow this procedure for the PA6/PHIAE 60:40 and 80:20 compositions IFig. 4(b)].Then, the small holes due to heterogeneities could be seen in the surface of both blends; holes being smaller than 0.9 um and uniformly distributed on the matrix. This result reflects the good adhesion between present phases, and the small size of the dispersed phases suggests that certain amount of PHAE should be present in the amorphous phase rich in PA6.

Miscible blend; SEMPhase-sepd.; SEM
For studying the morphology and the external form of a material, SEM can be used. Figures 4(a-c) show the morphology of different blends observed by optical microscopy. The SEM picture shows that the surface of blends was apparently smooth and blending process was accomplished successfully. The thermal properties and SEM studies of blends shows that PANi-PVAc blend was miscible and PANi-PS and PANi-PVC blends were disperse in One another. [24]

Large number of small sized crystals formed in PVDF/PMMA blend are beta-phase crystals of PVDF, transformation from alpha-phase crystals occurred in the presence of a-MWNTs (POM)
SEM micrographs of 70/30 PVDF/PMMA neat blends are shown in Figure 5a. PVDF spherulites are apparent from this micrograph (as indicated) and more interestingly, the pores in the interspherulitic regions are also very evident, which is a manifestation of the etched PMMA phase. As mentioned earlier, amorphous PMMA can segregate in the liquid-ike interlamellar regions within the spherulites and in the interspherulitic regions. It is worth mentioning that previous reports suggest that PMMA is excluded from the crystallineamorphous interphase of PVDF and segregates mainly in the interlamellar regions of PVDF, especially in blends with PVDF content >50 wt %.

Spherically shaped particles (very compact and hard agglomerates);SEM
At 5 min of processing time [Fig. 3(a)), a compact and hard structure is observed, mainly due to the PAni-DBSA phase not being mixed with EPDM. PAni obtained by dispersion processing exhibits spherically shaped particles, which tend to make very compact and hard agglomerates.

One can clearly see that the morphologies coincide with those detected by AFM and therefore the same conclusions can be drawn from them.

Smooth surface without any stress whitening area observed (SEM)
To establish the structure-property relation, the morphology of the ternary blends was observed by SEM. The SEM micrographs of the blends are shown in Fig. 5. For PVCl Q-MSAN blends(see Fig.5 (A)),a smooth surface without any stress whitening areas is observed, whichis typical of a rigid and glassy surface, indicating brittle fracture [24J.A transition from brittle to ductile fracture is observed with the addition of 8 phr CPE in Fig. 5(D). The rough and coarse surface with domain distortions and areas of whitening reveals the improvement in toughness [25] At higher magnification, the structure is rather heterogeneous. Some voids of about 0.5 um in size are observed implying the pullout of the disperse phase after impact fracture. The voids could also make a contribution to the increase in toughness and indicate that CPEis immiscible with PVC/o-MSAN matrix [121. For blends with 10 or more phr CPE, the surfaces are composed of several separated tiny platelets, and the separated platelets begin to overlap each other at high levels of CPE to dissipate more energy in fracture [16,26]. It is interesting to note that the morphology transition from Fig.5(A)- (D) is more obvious than that from Fig. 5(E)-(G).

As mechanical properties of rubber-toughened polymers should be dependent on the state of rubber phase including particle Size as well as the rubber content, morphology of the blends was examined. Figure 1 showed the cryofiactured surfaces of K-10 and K7A3-10. The surface of K-10 (Figure 1(a)) revealed the typical morphology of an immiscible blend with large and polydisperse spherical mEOR particles in PK matrix, which was a result of high interfacial tension and coalescence. It was also observed that some of the mEOR particles had been removed during the fracture process, leaving smooth and clean marks, due to the lack of interfacial adhesion. Fracture surface of K7A3-10 was markedly different from that of K-10; the rubber phase structure was not distinguishable, and detachment at the interface was not observed (Figure 1(b)). Figure 1(c) showed the surface of the same blend after the mEOR phase had been extracted by etching with hexane. Compared with K-10 a finer dispersion of submicron-sized domains was observed, which indicated the effective compatibilization of added PA6. When the hexane treated (mEOR-removed) sample was further treated with formic acid, the surface revealed a still finer dispersion of PA6 domains with tens of nanometers in diameter (Figure 1(d)).

Partially miscible (DSC, two Tg)
Morphology is an important factor in determining the physical properties of the polymer blends. Figure P shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the fractured surface roughly normal to the extrusion direction. From Figure 1(a), it is clearly visible that POE particles were dispersed in the PBT matrix. When the components have different melt viscosities, the morphology of the blends depends on whether the minor component has a lower viscosity Or a higher viscosity. If the minor component has a lower viscosity than the major one, 12,13 the minor component will be finely dispersed. The immiscibility of the two components resulted in phase segregation, where the minor phase was dispersed in large spherical domains and the dispersion was Poor. As can be seen when Figure 1(a,b) are compared, the size of dispersed phase clearly decreased with the addition of mPOE. The decrease was from ca. 6-8 um (PBT/ POE) to ca. 2-4 um (PBT/mPOE/POE). This decrease i size with the mPOE addition indicates that compatibility has been improved. Figure 1(e) shows the homogeneous character of the morphology in PBT /mPOE blend, where the mPOE phase was hardly distinguishable from the PBT matrix and the size of dispersed phase was ＜1 um. This decrease in the particle size may be due to improved dispersibility attributable to reactions of the anhydride Sroups in mPOE and the OH in PBT 14,15 at the iterface. The change in MFI is used as an indirect evidence for reaction in the melt.16 The MFI of neat PBT, PBT /POE, PBT /mPOE/ POE and PBT/ mPOE are respectively 19.8, 19.4, 18.3, and 16.1. The MFI reduced in the presence of mPOE indicative of a reaction taking place at interface between PBT and POE.16
